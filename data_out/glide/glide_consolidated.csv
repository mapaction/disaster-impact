This has caused the massive death of fish and other aquatic animal species in the ecosystem, and is considered the most serious environmental problem of its kind in the national territory .\n\nOn June 12 the Governor of Petén declared an Orange Alert for the entire Department and that same day the Mayor of Sayaxché declared a Red Alert. These are still in place in order to prioritize emergency care.\n\nAs a precautionary measure authorities have prohibited the use and consumption of water from the river, therefore, people need water for consumption given that 48% of families get their water supply directly from the La Pasión River.']",[]

Despite an International salvage response to refloat the vessel the situation has worsened over the past few days due to the adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe Rena has suffered substantial structure failure, with cracks appearing in the hull. This has been caused by the movement of the vessel as the stern, which has remained afloat, shifting with the waves, while the front part of the ship remains stuck on the reef.\n\nUrgent aerial surveillance is required. Current weather conditions are hampering such operations. Suitable EOS applications are now required to assist in the detection of pollution.

Residential buildings, water infrastructure, and energy infrastructure have been damaged as well, with continued disruption of service, while communications and internet connectivity have also been compromised. Both private and public facilities have been ransacked, and some burnt down, including on the premises of SRCS.  \n\nThe latest ceasefire has partially held, allowing evacuations to take place and some families to restock. However, food and water shortages, and lack of fuel, are leading to sharp increases in the cost of these basic commodities, while the price of transportation out of conflict areas is unaffordable for many. Families are prioritising the evacuation of women and children, who are exposed to heightened risks including sexual and gender-based violence, as reported by women-led organisations in Sudan . \n\nAfter 15 days of uninterrupted fighting, the full extent of the humanitarian situation is yet to be determined, but to date this conflict has put at least 9 million Sudanese, chiefly those living near the clashes, under severe hardship, unable to access emergency healthcare or medicines for those suffering from chronic conditions. The health facilities that remain functional lack staff and equipment, and the available blood is at risk due to power cuts in the cold chain. Women who are about to give birth cannot access ante-natal care and may be at risk of delivering without medical supervision. Lack of access to potable water is also leading people to seek water from the Nile, which could lead to a spike in diarrhoeal diseases, and will have repercussions on the nutrition status of children and pregnant and lactating women. \n\nWidespread displacement is ongoing, mainly in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur.

In light of this, the CRT conducted a situation update mission, reporting 22,000 people affected by the crisis, including 8,857 IDPs including refugees and 13,861 host populations. \n\nThe situation of the branches also shows that the villages attacked are mainly in the North East of the Savannah region and on the Burkinabe border, while the populations have found refuge in the more secure villages in the South of the Savannah region.

The displaced persons are said to be fleeing from the attacks, but they are also fleeing following warnings within the communities of possible attacks, whether or not they are actually planned.

It should be remembered that the majority of these displaced persons arrived in host families without the minimum of facilities for their integration.

Situated west is the Diwata Mountain Range, isolating the province from the rest of Mindanao. \n\nCaraga is susceptible to landslides due to its rugged terrain, while the Agusan River Valley (the third largest river basin in the country, with a total drainage area of 11,937 square kilometres and an estimated length of 390 kilometres from its head origin in Compostela Valley) that stretches all the way to Davao, Butuan and Surigao makes the region prone to flash floods. \n\nAs the LPA moves closer, government authorities are likely to pre-emptively evacuate families living near the coast, riverbanks, landslide prone areas and other vulnerable places. The rain from the weather disturbance is expected to cause floods and landslides which is expected to cause casualties and damage to shelter, crops, livestock and livelihoods.']",[]

Equatorial Guinea currently does not have laboratory capacity to test for VHF, hence samples from those who were sick and from close contacts were sent to Gabon and Senegal. The samples sent for testing in Gabon were negative, but the out of the eight samples sent to Dakar, Senegal, one tested positive for Marburg virus. \n\nOn 13 February 2023, the Equatorial Guinea MoH officially declared the outbreak. (https://www.afro.who.int/countries/equatorial-guinea/news/equatorial-guinea-confirms-first-ever-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak) \n\nAs of 17 February, 1 case is confirmed, 8 are probable (deaths from individuals with VHF symptoms that were not tested) and 16 suspect cases in isolation (2 are showing signs and symptons). 21 additional are considered secondary contacts. There is restricted access to Kie Ntem district, with an estimated 4,235 people in quarantine.  \n\nThe affected district is located in the north-east of Equatorial Guinea mainland, bordering Cameroon and Gabon. Several suspected cases were identified in Cameroon, but all samples were negative for Marburg virus. There is no notification of cases or symptoms related to Marburg on the Gabonese territory.\n\nMarburg Virus Disease (MVM) is a highly virulent disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, with a case fatality rate of up to 88%. It belongs to the same family of viruses that causes Ebola virus disease. The disease caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days. The virus is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the body fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the virus. However, supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival.\n\nThe Marburg outbreak declared on 13 February 2023 is the first VHF outbreak in Equatorial Guinea. At present, the epidemiological situation is as follows: \n•\t1 case confirmed, 9 deaths (8 probable cases, 1 confirmed), 16 suspect cases in isolation, 2 of those in isolation are showing signs and symptoms. 21 are considered “secondary contacts” and in isolation at home.  \n•\tEstimated 4,325 people in quarantine and restricted access to Kie Ntem District. \nHowever, given the low levels of contact tracing, the reduced number of samples collected, the lack of testing capacity in country, the time required to collect and send samples to other countries, and the delays in obtaining results, these numbers may not reflect entirely the reality of the outbreak. The attack rate is also considerably high, at 23% for relatives and 81% for those providing direct care to infected persons when precautions are not strictly practiced. Moreover, case fatality ratios from past outbreaks have ranged from 24% to 88%, depending on the case management.  The above, associated with the time elapsed between the identification of the first symptoms (7 January) and the  confirmation of the virus (13 February), considerably heightens the potential of widespread infection, and poses challenges to the response and overall control of a very virulent outbreak. \n\nAccording to government information, initial alerts and deaths have been traced  back to public events which, according to local religious and cultural customs, bring together several dozen and sometimes hundreds of people. Untraced contacts in the community, rumours and lack of information within the communities could be an important transmission lever that needs to be managed urgently.   \nThe level of v']",[]

The fact that these were low-lying areas, the soil's saturation and the presence of crevices in basins (the most important in Argentina) caused by the constant rainfall throughout the year led to significant flooding and overflows from rivers and streams. The localities affected in this province by this emergency in this period were not affected by the rainy season in 2015 and 2016.\nPergamino, a city in northern Buenos Aires province was one of the most affected by the rainfall, receiving some 220 millimetres of water in 4 hours, causing the Pergamino Stream, its tributaries and effluents, such as Chu Creek, to overflow. This led to flooding throughout the city, which is organized into 24 urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods. The flooding, mainly impacted riverside neighbourhoods (the river cuts across the city) such as 9 de Julio, Cueto, Centenario, Tocha, San Vicente, Kennedy, Centro, 27 de Noviembre, Belgrano, Martín M. de G?emes and José Hernández (the latter three are considered informal settlements); and Jorge Newbery (also an informal settlement) along Chu Creek, affecting 13,650 people, i.e. around 11 per cent of the total population. Basic services such as power, telephony, internet and water were partially interrupted for some 36 hours (completely in affected neighbourhoods), and some stretches of National Routes 8 and 9 (the main access roads to Pergamino) were blocked completely by flooding, making it difficult to mobilize assistance from outside of the city.\n\nMore than 3,400 homes have been flooded (between 30 and 220 cm of water), forcing families to leave their homes as access is only possible by boat or some 4-wheel drive vehicles. According to Civil Defence reports, around 50 residents have refused to self-evacuate or be evacuated and remain on the roofs of their homes, and approximately 250 are being housed in four collective centres. At the family / individual level, in addition to some medical emergencies and health complications associated with the emergency (injuries, blood pressure issues, etc.), families have reported the loss of household items (furniture, appliances, household goods, bedding, etc.) and sanitation issues such as garbage, waterlogged structures, vermin, vectors. These issues have been exacerbated by the meteorological conditions that are typical for this time of year, such as mean temperatures above 24? C (with highs above 32? C), high humidity, unstable weather conditions and the pre-existing pollution of the Pergamino Stream.\n\nIn addition to partial structural damage to dwellings and some public buildings (Primary Health Care Centres [CAPS] in G?emes and José Hernández neighbourhoods), the blocks adjacent to the Pergamino Stream have large amounts of accumulated debris and waste, which have been hard to remove because of the difficulty in accessing these streets. While the city does have a Local Response Plan, it failed to fully anticipate the storm's effects, catching a great number of families by surprise in their homes. On 25 December, the city formally declared a state alert, including a health alert, due to the level of impact suffered.\n\nIn Cordoba Province, the strong storm that hit the area on 26 December caused damage to electrical and water services and forced 100 people to evacuate in Jovita. Twelve homes were damaged by hail, and electrical services were interrupted in La Cumbre and in La Falda due to high winds that damaged lamp posts. Six neighbourhoods suffered damage in Villa Dolores, 50 people had to self-evacuate and there were blocked roads and fallen lamp posts; additionally, the storm interrupted electrical and water services in Villa Giardini, Rio Ceballos, Salsipuedes, Agua de Oro, Jesús María and Colonia Caroya. More than 200 people in Santa Fe Province were forced to evacuate. The cities of Rosario and Alvarez were the most affected, as overflowing channels left half of the city cut off and hindered the evacuation efforts. Provincial authorities reported up to one metre of water in dwellings, including the Volunteer Fire Department facilities, which had to be evacuated as well. The National Society is coordinating state assistance in the form of mattresses, blankets, food, bags and tarps; relevant Ministry of Health agencies are working on site.""]",[]

They led to an increase in the level of the Oubangui River, which overflowed its bed, causing flooding in the riparian areas of Arrondissements 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, Bimbo and Bégoua. This situation increases the vulnerability of the victims in these areas which were already affected during the successive floods suffered during the months of July and August 2022 and which left more than 21,700 people homeless across the country, and refugees in families of reception, schools and churches (OCHA, August 2022). The rains of September 28 added to this already significant balance sheet despite the mobilization of the actors on the ground whose actions started since the beginning of the flood season are running out of steam.\nThe impact of the floods that occurred on September 28 leaves a significant gap in assistance with many needs. The National Society's assessment reveals thousands of houses weakened by water, hundreds of latrines and wells damaged or destroyed by water. The losses of equipment and cultivable land are considerable as the normal harvest season approaches, which should begin in October. Twenty-two (22) injured were also recorded. Most of the victims are located in arrondissements 2, 3, 5 and 6 which are considered priority one zones by the Government. Monitoring of the towns of Paoua, Kouango and Bambari which were also hit by floods following heavy rainfall. They represent the localities most affected by the floods. The houses being either flooded or destroyed, the population moved to host families or schools. The density and frequency of rains to date and the continuity of precipitation in the coming weeks raise fears of a worsening of the situation. According to the seasonal calendar the rains should continue until the end of October (Source: SEASONAL CALENDAR FOR A TYPICAL YEAR, FEWS NET).\nFrom National Society assessment, There are 24,758 people affected by the floods: 21,407 homeless people due to these successive floods, 4,281 households affected with 2,823 houses completely destroyed, 1,458 houses partially destroyed, 53 people injured, 02 loss of life. 2417 damaged family latrines, 1092 damaged and contaminated water wells, 05 broken bridges and all water pipes are clogged and overflowed.

Similar\ninstructions were given to the regional and local authorities to conduct rapid assessments upon which the\ngovernment and its partner humanitarian organisations could build plans to access the victims with adequate quality assistance.\nOfficial statistics (as of 6 September) reflected the following:\n? In B?bidja, 15 days of heavy rains with a recorded water level of 346 mm rendered 1,063 families homeless\n(average size five persons) homeless. 1,706 houses; 217 sanitation facilities (bathrooms and toilets)\ndestroyed; 18 water wells; and 626 walls/and house fences were destroyed or collapsed.\n?

The more impacted departments are Bolivar, with 264,000 affected people, followed by Magdalena with 161,000, C?rdoba with 151,000 and Sucre with 107,000. \nUnfortunately, the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies forecasts that La Ni?a phenomenon and its strong rains will continue until the first trimester of 2011. This could mean the overlapping of the rainy seasons of 2010 with the first rainy season of 2011 (March-April-May).\n \nOn 18 November, the Minister of Justice, German Vargas Lleras, declared a state of public calamity in 28 of the 32 Departments of the country. The government hopes to facilitate the gathering of additional resources, as the country?s capabilities have been overloaded. This declaration also fastens the processes to receive international aid and supports subjects such as housing and agriculture.']",[]

The incident caused widespread damage to houses, infrastructure, and vehicles. Muddy water swept into people’s homes in Erbil's Daratu, Qushtapa, Shamamk, Zhyan, Roshinbiri, and Bahrka neighbourhoods in the early hours of the morning, forcing individuals out of their houses. As of 19 December, 14 people were reported dead by the floods, while IRCS carried further rapid assessments to confirm with the affected families""]",[]

On 10 October, Bago River water level reached 4 feet above the danger level which caused widespread flooding in urban and sub-urban areas. The impact of this flooding has been significant.

However, food, water, basic household needs, hygiene and sanitation are immediate needs by looking at current flood impact, pre-existing vulnerabilities and complexity of the country as well as a request from MRCS regional branches.\n\nBy looking at the level of a flood, the density of the population and based on initial data as well as preexisting vulnerability data, it can be expected that likely result in direct needs related to essential household, food, drinking water, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), livelihoods and health support. The overall impact will be known once needs are determined following the completion of the rapid needs assessment.\n\nExisting data shows that multidimensional variables influence the level of vulnerability of most flood-affected townships including poverty incidence and shelter construction typologies.

The death toll for the event:\nFlood-related:\nTennessee--7\nNorth Carolina--2\nSouth Carolina--1\nKentucky--1\nAlabama--1\nIce storm-related:\nNew York--9\nMaine--5\nNew Hampshire--2\n\nThe heaviest rains and most severe flooding occurred in the mountains of North Carolina and northeast Tennessee, where up to 16 inches fell in a 2-day period. See below for some of the rainfall totals. Surveys indicate over 500 homes destroyed or with severe damage in North Carolina, and over 200 homes severely damaged or destroyed in Tennessee. Damages exceeded $15 million for western North Carolina and $20 million for eastern Tennessee. Tornado touchdowns produced some damage in Dublin, Georgia and Easley, South Carolina. Flooding also was a problem in parts of the lower Mississippi valley and upstate New York.\n\nThe severe ice storm mainly affected upstate New York, northern New Hampshire and Vermont, much of Maine, and southeast Canada. Some locations received over 3 inches of rain (as freezing rain), with radial ice thickness of one inch or more. Canada reported over 3 million utility customers without power immediately after the storm, while the northeast through New England reported over 500,000 customers without power. 80% of Maine's population lost electrical service. Overall damages approached $3 billion for Canada and were at least $1.4 billion for the U.S.""]",[]

The impact has been particularly devastating in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) sites and surrounding communities, where homes, farms, and livelihoods have been destroyed. The situation is compounded by the challenges in accessing affected areas, as the movement of landmines, road damage, and the widespread nature of the impacted communities hinder the delivery of essential aid. These floods have not only inflicted widespread damage on infrastructure and homes but have also intensified vulnerabilities, particularly among IDPs who were already living in precarious conditions. The convergence of the floods with Yemen's protracted conflict has created urgent needs in shelter, health services, and food security, further complicated by significant health risks, including potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases and the displacement of unexploded ordnances.

More than half of the country's dams are overpilling and this could exacerbate flooding resulting displacement of people and increasing the incidence of both water borne and vector diseases.""]",[]

The only land access to the area from the south on foot until traffic can be resumed over the lone access road (National Route N? 9); however, the area can be supplied from cities located to the north of the province such as Tilcara, as access to those areas is still possible. \n\nThe town of Bárcena, with a population of 158 people, is located 10 km south of Volcán (31 km north of San Salvador de Jujuy); this entire area has been affected. A total of 100 people have been evacuated, of which 15 are being housed at Mountain Infantry Regiment (RIM 20) facilities, while others were transported to San Salvador de Jujuy. Due to the suddenness of the landslide, two people lost their lives while travelling through the town along National Route 9.\n\nThe communities of Leon, Santa Barbara, Purmamarca, Humahuaca and San Martín, located north of the landslide in Volcán, were hit by flash floods during this same period; local authorities have assisted the affected families\n\nCurrently, these communities are without communication, electricity and public services (water and sanitation). In regard to the electrical supply, the government estimates that it could be restored back to normal within the next 48 hours in some areas; however, no estimated time has been given for restoring the drinking water supply and sewage services. Local access to health (emergency services, health centres) is practically impossible due to the mud in the streets, as well as to the damage suffered by the physical facilities that provided these services. The province\'s Civil Defence Coordination has set up radio communications equipment, but it is not yet known when fixed and mobile telephone service will be restored.']",[]

This is a 32% increase compared with the immediate previous year. A total of 319,244 metric tonnes will be required to cover the cereal deficit that the country is facing. \n\nThe figures documented by the ZIMVAC assessment are primarily rural households and do not include the urban households. As has become a trend in food insecurity, the severely affected provinces in terms of percentage of food insecure population are; Matebeleland North (40%), Matebeleland South (32%), Masvingo (32%) and Midlands (30%). Post-harvest losses account to 20-30% of grain losses. Below is a table highlighting the most affected provinces and districts.\n\nLate onset of rainfall, pro-longed dry spells and erratic rainfall coupled with limited access to inputs account for the poor performance of the 2012/13 agricultural season. The ZIMVAC report also notes that levels of child severe acute malnutrition exceed the globally accepted rates (4.7% compared to  the global rate of 2%).  Zimbabwe Red Cross has decided to target Gwanda district which has a population of 112,267. The district was targeted because there is no other organisation responding to acute food insecurity in the district.  There are 24 operational wards with a total of 26,773 households.

See below for some of the rainfall totals. Surveys indicate over 500 homes destroyed or with severe damage in North Carolina, and over 200 homes severely damaged or destroyed in Tennessee. Damages exceeded $15 million for western North Carolina and $20 million for eastern Tennessee. Tornado touchdowns produced some damage in Dublin, Georgia and Easley, South Carolina. Flooding also was a problem in parts of the lower Mississippi valley and upstate New York.\n\nThe severe ice storm mainly affected upstate New York, northern New Hampshire and Vermont, much of Maine, and southeast Canada. Some locations received over 3 inches of rain (as freezing rain), with radial ice thickness of one inch or more. Canada reported over 3 million utility customers without power immediately after the storm, while the northeast through New England reported over 500,000 customers without power. 80% of Maine\'s population lost electrical service.

A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States. The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known, as the hurricane destroyed all the wind-recording instruments in the landfall area. The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph. Columbia, Mississippi, located 75 miles inland, reported 120 mph sustained winds. A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches. However, as Camille passed over the Virginias, it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches. Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage.']",[]

Novarupta (Katmai) Volcano, Alaska, erupted considerably more material in 1912, but owing to the isolation and sparse population of the region affected, there were no human deaths and little property damage. In contrast, Mount St. Helens' eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property, primarily by the debris avalanche, the lateral blast, and the mudflows.\n\nLandscape changes caused by the May 18 eruption were readily seen on high-altitude photographs. Such images, however, cannot reveal the impacts of the devastation on people and their works. The May 18 eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 57 lives. Within the United States before May 18, 1980, only two known casualties had been attributed to volcanic activity - a photographer was struck by falling rocks during the explosive eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in 1924; and an Army sergeant who disappeared during the 1944 eruption of Cleveland Volcano, Chuginadak Island, Aleutians. Autopsies indicated that most of Mount St. Helens' victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash, and some by thermal and other injuries.  Accurate cost figures remain difficult to determine. Early estimates were too high and ranged from $2 to $3 billion, primarily reflecting the timber, civil works, and agricultural losses. A refined estimate of $1.1 billion was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.""]",[]

High winds have also helped the bushfires to spread, with some fires jumping over highways and roads.
